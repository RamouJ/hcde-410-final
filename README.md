<p>This research project is going to attempt to answer the following questions: which sectors of the Seattle Police Department use the most force, on what days are Seattle police officers more likey to use force, and is there a correlation between race and the level of force used? I plan to research these answers by aggregating the data based on the location where the incident occured, the level of force used, and the type of force used. Then I will visualize the data through bar charts, histograms, heat maps, matrixes, and present them on a dashboard. I hope to help better inform civilians about the interactions they have with officers from the Seattle Police Department.</p>
